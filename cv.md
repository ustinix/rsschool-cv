## About Me
I am a sales manager and in my job I do not see further ways of development, so I think it is a good time to learn something new. In my work I liked most of all to be useful to customers, which is why in IT I chose the profession of Frontend-developer, because it is a programmer who is closest to the user, who is responsible for the convenience of the site and its visual perception. He can make the navigation understandable, the site's response is instant, and the animation is "live".

## Code example

Task from codewars: There was a test in your class and you passed it. Congratulations!
But you're an ambitious person. You want to know if you're better than the average student in your class.
You receive an array with your peers' test scores. Now calculate the average and compare your score!
Return true if you're better, else false!

Note:
Your points are not included in the array of your class's points. Do not forget them when calculating the average score!

Solution:
```
function betterThanAverage(classPoints, yourPoints) {
  let total = 0;
  let avg = 0;
  for(i = 0; i < classPoints.length; i++) {
    total += classPoints[i];
    avg = total / classPoints.length;
  }

  if(avg < yourPoints) {
      return true
  } else {
    return false
  }
}

```
