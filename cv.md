## About Me
I am a sales manager and in my job I do not see further ways of development, so I think it is a good time to learn something new. In my work I liked most of all to be useful to customers, which is why in IT I chose the profession of Frontend-developer, because it is a programmer who is closest to the user, who is responsible for the convenience of the site and its visual perception. He can make the navigation understandable, the site's response is instant, and the animation is "live".
